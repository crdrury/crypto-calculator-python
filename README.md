This Python program using the TkInter interface for GUI support. The program accepts two cryptocurrencies, identified by their symbols, and displays conversion data from the first to the second.

In order to run the program yourself, you will need to obtain a free API key from https://coinmarketcap.com/api. Paste your key value into the API_KEY variable in CryptoCalculator.py.
