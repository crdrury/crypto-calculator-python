# Crypto Calculator (Python)

This Python program using the TkInter interface for GUI support and the MatPlotLib library for data visualization. The program accepts a string of cryptocurrencies, identified by their symbols and separated by commas, and displays conversion data from the first to the second.

The program accesses the [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) API to look up accurate, up-to-date price data. In order to run the program yourself, you will need to obtain a free API key from https://coinmarketcap.com/api. Paste your key value into the API_KEY variable in CryptoCalculator.py.
